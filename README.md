# Drop-in switcher for previewing minimal CSS frameworks

This is a quick drop-in CSS switcher to allow for previewing some of the many minimal CSS-only frameworks that are available. See the [demo](https://dohliam.github.io/dropin-minimal-css) or [drop the switcher](#usage) into your own page to see how [different frameworks](#list-of-frameworks) would look together with your content.

This project only includes _minimal_ frameworks, in other words, boilerplate frameworks that require no adjustment of the corresponding HTML and can be simply dropped into the project to provide a starting point for further design. No additional javascript, compiling, pre-processors, or fiddling with classes should be required for these to look good and be responsive.

## Usage

To use the CSS switcher, just add the following line anywhere within the body tag on your page:

        <script src="https://dohliam.github.io/dropin-minimal-css/switcher.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

That's it! You should now be able to cycle through the different frameworks by choosing them from the dropdown at the top of the page.

## Adding frameworks

If you know of a minimal framework that hasn't been included here, by all means create an [issue](https://github.com/dohliam/dropin-minimal-css/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/dohliam/dropin-minimal-css/pulls) so that we can add it to the list!

## Bookmarklet

You can now try out the experimental dropin-css bookmarklet. Just paste the following code into your address bar to create a CSS switcher for any site:

```javascript
javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20body%20%3D%20document.getElementsByTagName('body')%5B0%5D%3Bscript%20%3D%20document.createElement('script')%3Bscript.type%3D%20'text%2Fjavascript'%3Bscript.src%3D%20'https%3A%2F%2Fdohliam.github.io%2Fdropin-minimal-css%2Fswitcher.js'%3Bbody.appendChild(script)%7D)()
```

Or alternatively, drag the link at the top of the [demo page](https://dohliam.github.io/dropin-minimal-css) to your browser's bookmark bar.
